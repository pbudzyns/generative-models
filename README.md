# Generative models

## Variational Auto Encoder
Implementing Variational Auto Encoder (VAE) from the scratch. 
Use Gaussian and Bernoulli priors to train the model on MNIST dataset 
and to generate new images. Compare VAE with deterministic Auto Encoder and use 
Gaussian Mixture Models to transform the latter into a generative model. 

## Monte Carlo Markov Chains
Implement various sampling methods. Use `PyMC` to sample from observed data 
and estimate posterior distribution.
